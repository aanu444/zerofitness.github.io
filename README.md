# README for Zero Fitness Website

# Zero Fitness is a fictional fitness centre, their vision: to turn fat into fit.

I made the first deployment of this site on the 1st of February, 2021 and built it using:
- Html
- Sass 

{**Updated versions will give insight into what was used to complete the entirety of the site design.**}

**Version 1.0.0** which contained only the index page

I designed this website using Figma. This is the link to the slider here: <https://www.figma.com/proto/65eHGPyJ6GO8ieAk8aaC6u/Untitled?node-id=1%3A2&scaling=scale-down>
